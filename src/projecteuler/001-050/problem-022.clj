;; Project Euler
;; Problem 22: Names Scores
;;
;; https://projecteuler.net/problem=22
;;
;; Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing
;; over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working 
;; out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position 
;; in the list to obtain a name score.
;; 
;; For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 
;; 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score 
;; of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
;;
;; What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
